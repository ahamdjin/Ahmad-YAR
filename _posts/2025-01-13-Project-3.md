**Overview:** This project showcases the journey of troubleshooting and optimizing data relationships, creating calculated measures, and designing insightful visualizations in Power BI. The work was guided through collaboration with ChatGPT, demonstrating problem-solving strategies and leveraging DAX functions to produce meaningful results.

### **Project Background**

**Objective:** The primary goal of the project was to analyze e-commerce data, resolve ambiguous relationships between tables, and create dynamic measures and visualizations to understand campaign performance and customer demographics effectively.

**Tools Used:**

* Microsoft Power BI  
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
* E-commerce Dataset

---

### **Key Challenges and Solutions**

1. **Ambiguous Relationships Between Tables:**

   * **Challenge:** There was an ambiguous path between the `ecommerce_sales`, `ecommerce_campaigns`, and `ecommerce_time` tables, leading to inactive relationships and data aggregation issues.  
   * **Solution:**  
     * Established an indirect relationship between `ecommerce_sales[TransactionID]` and `ecommerce_campaigns[CampaignID]` using the `USERELATIONSHIP` function in calculated measures.  
     * Verified and aligned data types for key columns (e.g., `TransactionID`, `CampaignID`, and `StartDate`).  
2. **Creating Age Group Segmentation:**

   * **Challenge:** Segmenting customer age data into predefined groups for demographic analysis.  
   * **Solution:**

Used a calculated column with the following DAX formula to group age ranges:  
 Age Group \=

SWITCH(

    TRUE(),

    'ecommerce\_customers'\[Age\] \>= 18 && 'ecommerce\_customers'\[Age\] \<= 25, "18-25",

    'ecommerce\_customers'\[Age\] \>= 26 && 'ecommerce\_customers'\[Age\] \<= 35, "26-35",

    'ecommerce\_customers'\[Age\] \>= 36 && 'ecommerce\_customers'\[Age\] \<= 45, "36-45",

    'ecommerce\_customers'\[Age\] \>= 46 && 'ecommerce\_customers'\[Age\] \<= 55, "46-55",

    'ecommerce\_customers'\[Age\] \>= 56 && 'ecommerce\_customers'\[Age\] \<= 65, "56-65",

    "65+"

)

*   
3. **Dynamic Campaign Performance Visualization:**

   * **Challenge:** Displaying campaign metrics (Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, Revenue) in a single visualization and identifying trends over time.  
   * **Solution:**  
     * Designed a stacked bar chart for channel-wise metrics comparison.

Created a measure to activate non-default relationships for accurate trend analysis:  
 Impressions Over Time \=

CALCULATE(

    SUM(ecommerce\_campaigns\[Impressions\]),

    USERELATIONSHIP(ecommerce\_campaigns\[StartDate\], ecommerce\_time\[Date\])

)

*   
  * Enhanced the line chart by connecting the campaignâ€™s start dates with the e-commerce time table.  
4. **Improving Table Formatting:**

   * **Challenge:** Ensuring tabular data visualization is well-aligned and scales properly when resized.  
   * **Solution:**  
     * Adjusted the Power BI table settings to distribute columns evenly.  
     * Applied visual formatting for consistent spacing and responsiveness.

### **Final Deliverables**

1. **Visualizations:**

   * **Campaign Performance Dashboard:**  
     * Metrics: Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, Revenue.  
     * Visuals: Stacked bar chart and line chart for time-based performance trends.  
   * **Customer Demographics Analysis:**  
     * Age segmentation displayed in a bar chart.  
   * **Product Sales Report:**  
     * Tabular data summarizing revenue and quantity sold by product name.  
2. **Key Measures Created:**

   * `Revenue by Campaign`: Activated inactive relationships to link transactions with campaigns.  
   * `Impressions Over Time`: Highlighted trends in impressions linked to the time dimension.  
3. **Resolved Data Model Issues:**

   * Aligned data types across tables.  
   * Established functional indirect relationships using DAX.

### **Learning Outcomes**

* Gained expertise in troubleshooting complex data relationships in Power BI.  
* Developed proficiency in using DAX functions like `USERELATIONSHIP` and `SWITCH` for dynamic calculations.  
* Improved data visualization and formatting techniques for better presentation.  
* Leveraged AI assistance to brainstorm and implement advanced solutions.

### **Conclusion**

This project illustrates the effective application of Power BI for e-commerce data analysis and visualization. By overcoming challenges in data modeling and visualization, the final deliverables provide actionable insights into campaign performance and customer demographics. The collaboration with ChatGPT highlights the potential of AI in guiding complex problem-solving in data analytics.
